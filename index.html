        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economicsüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Patrick Seon and I am currently a student at UC Riverside majoring as an economist student. I first planned on majoring in business because of my love, passion and dreams of owning a big business. Since my childhood my father has been an entrepreneur all his life. I really didn‚Äôt think much of it until seeing him being the boss of people and being able to do his own thing. This interested me a lot. Ever since I‚Äôve been researching and studying different facts on entrepreneurs it has had me thinking, ‚ÄúWhat can I do to make myself a successful business.‚Äù 

  I had many thoughts of different businesses such as inventing a new product that solves a certain problem, but this type of business would be very costly, so it was a no. I decided that I needed to start somewhere small. I chose to start a clothing brand making clothes from my house with an embroidery machine and a heat printer. I would buy blank apparel from wholesalers downtown and just put my logo onto the clothes. My online shop was set up but I wouldn't get much sales because of my poor skills in advertising. I didn‚Äôt like the thought of spending money on ads or influencers to show them off. I was young, money was not something I could easily get. The only thing i could think of here was making and taking advantage of a social media account to let the world know what kind of brand we were. 

  I would get a few followers and weeks would pass by with not a single sale. This devastated me. The next option was to pitch this idea to my dad and show what i had. He liked the idea and supported me. He invested into my business and with the 200 dollars i received I was able to finally pay for ads. I had to figure out which ads would help and which wouldn't. After 4 hours of ad running I finally got my first sale. This first sale was officially the start of my journey of growing as an entrepreneur. For a month I got a decent amount of orders but it started to die out and I didnt really have a passion for clothing. I decided that i should stop this and find a different way of making money as an entrepreneur. Thats when i found out about dropshipping on a youtube ad. This caught my eye. The fact that I can make a website, run ads, and not worry about shipping or having inventory was amazing. I poured all the money I earned from my clothing brand and started drop shipping right away. I had to choose a product which was fishing bait. Fishing bait at the time was going up in sales. All i had to do was make my website and run ads now. With my knowledge of running ads from my clothing business i figured out the right ads for my products and orders started rushing in the next day. With that money I would invest more of it into more ads which then would increase the orders day by day. This was a dream come true. I made a few thousand my the end of my second month of dropshipping. Sadly after 2 months the product wasn‚Äôt doing well. I wonder what business idea would be next?
